# responsive_design_challenges

- Challenge 1 - Responsive Layout: In this challenge I created a grid layout with 3 columns and 4 rows once in responsive mode the rows increases to 7 rows. This made it much easier to work with by setting out each cell to an attribute. By creating a grid layout it helped to make the responsiveness much easier and simpler
- Challenge 2 - Responsive Layout 2: In this challenge I was given the instructions to recreate an existing website where all structure had to be displayed. With this a grid structure was made to settle this need. By creating the grid structure I was able to alter each resolution by changing the layout. All images were used from the site to make it look more original.
